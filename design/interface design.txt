Interfaces:
	Interfaces are made of control instructions that are decided
	by the user. Interfaces contain certain systems/components 
	and delegate where data goes. They also handle all updates to components
	and the window.

Systems:
	Systems take data from components and modify it appropriately. 
	Systems can return data to the interface to be sent back to a 
	component.

Components:
	Contain data and are contained in vectors within interfaces
